title: 'Forcing 5g on Jio to Avoid Unwanted Data Charges'
---
Jio offers unlimited 5G data on select plans, but only when connected to a 5G network. If your phone drops to 4G, it starts consuming your limited data — and 4G is often slower.

## The Problem

In areas with unstable 5G coverage, phones automatically switch to 4G. This not only slows down data but also uses up your regular quota.

## Quick Solution

You can force your phone to stay on 5G using a hidden Android settings screen — **no app or root required**.

### Steps:

1. Open your dialer and enter: `*#*#4636#*#*`
2. Select **Phone Information**.
3. Scroll to **Set Preferred Network Type**.
4. Choose `NR only` to stay on 5G.

## Shoutout

Shoutout to the **[11 Cell Network Changer](https://codeberg.org/Tre_brock/11-Cell-Network-Changer)** app for helping me discover this solution. If you prefer a UI-based method, this app makes accessing those hidden settings so much easier.

This simple tweak helps ensure you're always on Jio's free 5G data when available, preventing unwanted 4G switching and data usage.
