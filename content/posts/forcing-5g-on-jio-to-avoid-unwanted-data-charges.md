title: 'Forcing 5g on Jio to Avoid Unwanted Data Charges'
---
Jio offers unlimited 5G data on select plans, but only when connected to a 5G network. If your phone drops to 4G, it starts consuming your limited data — and 4G is often slower.

## The Problem

In areas with unstable 5G coverage, phones automatically switch to 4G. This not only slows down data but also uses up your regular quota.

## Quick Solution

You can force your phone to stay on 5G using a hidden Android settings screen — **no app or root required**.

### Steps:

1. Open your dialer and enter: `*#*#4636#*#*`
2. Select **Phone Information**.
3. Scroll to **Set Preferred Network Type**.
4. Choose `NR only` or `NR/LTE` to stay on 5G.

## Optional App

If you prefer a UI-based method, try **[11 Cell Network Changer](https://codeberg.org/Tre_brock/11-Cell-Network-Changer)**. It simplifies access to the same hidden settings.

This simple tweak helps ensure you're always on Jio's free 5G data when available, preventing unwanted 4G switching and data usage.
